    "# Goal\n",
    "Now that we are able to detect the HexBugs using the `Yolo` model we trained, we can crop the specific regions containing the targets. But there is a catch!\n",
    "Bounded rectangles doesn't have same shape! We need them to have same shape to feed them to our CNN model. To do so, we analyze the boundary box and crop the image in a way that it has a shape of `(300, 300)`. Since the predicted coordinations in the cropped image need to be scaled, we keep track of the boundary box's coordinations as well, and save them in a `data.csv` file to work with later."
